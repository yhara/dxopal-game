## How to create a game

TBA

(basically just clone this repo, `cp -r hello yourgame` and open
yourgame/index.html in your browser. you don't need ruby installed.

Note that you cannot use Google Chrome to test your game because
it does not allow Ajax for `file://`. Use Firefox, Safari, etc. or
run a server to serve index.html)
